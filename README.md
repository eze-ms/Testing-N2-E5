# Map Key Validation Test

## 📄 Description
This Java project uses AssertJ and JUnit 5 to test the presence of keys in a `Map`. It includes functionality to verify if a specific key exists in the map after adding key-value pairs. The project serves as an example of efficient collection testing.

### Functionality
1. **Core Features:**
    - Initialize a `Map` with key-value pairs.
    - Verify that a specific key exists in the map.

2. **Robust Design:**
    - Implements fluent and readable assertions using AssertJ.
    - Demonstrates best practices for testing Java collections.
